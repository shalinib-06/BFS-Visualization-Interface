## Algorithm Explanation
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. 
In pathfinding, BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### How it works:
- Start from the initial node
- Explore all neighboring nodes at the present depth
- Move to the next level of nodes
- Continue until the target node is found

### Requirements 
- Python 3 or higher
- PyGame library
